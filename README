Summary of HMM POS Tagger

main.py:
This program implements a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger using the Brown corpus. It includes:
Baseline Evaluation: Tags words based on the most likely tag.
HMM Tagging: Predicts tags using transition and emission probabilities.
Add-One Smoothing: Enhances HMM accuracy for rare/unseen words.
Pseudo-Words: Generalizes rare words into categories to improve tagging performance.
Error Analysis: Outputs a confusion matrix and frequent tagging errors.
Run the program to train and evaluate models on the news category of the Brown corpus.
